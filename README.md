# Pathfinder-Stat-Roller
Stat roller for pathfinder

This is a simple stat roller for a party for Pathfinder.  Input is added to line 186 of roller.py.  Comments above that line explain the input.  Basically, you can choose your class and then use this to roll random stats for your character with certain assurances.  You can specify a primary and secondary stat for multiple characters and a minimum value for primary stats and secondary stats will have a value of at least primary stat minimum - 2.  You can also set a global minimum value so you can be sure no single stat will be below that value.  You can set a global high value and a maximum and minimum frequency of a value per character.  You can also set a maximum value for the number of odd valued rolls per character.  These assurances allow characters to have both a functional class preselected and unique rolls to promote organic character growth.  Characters a interpreted as pairs of primary and secondary stat prefrences.
